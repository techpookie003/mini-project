# Mini Project - Personal Profile Page

This is my first mini project as part of my coding course.  
It is a simple personal profile page created using only HTML, following the project requirements.  

## Features
- A header section with a title and navigation menu  
- A bio section with a short introduction and an image  
- A list of hobbies or interests  
- A footer section with contact details  

## Purpose
This project helped me practice HTML structure and semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.  

## How to view
Open the `index.html` file in any web browser to see the profile page.
